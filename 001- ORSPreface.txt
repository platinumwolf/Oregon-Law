PREFACE
 
2011 EDITION
 
          Publication of Oregon Revised Statutes. The Legislative Counsel Committee, pursuant to ORS 171.275, publishes Oregon Revised Statutes and distributes the up-to-date statute text, index, comparative section tables and annotations.
          The statute text of the first official edition of Oregon Revised Statutes, published in 1953, was bound in loose-part form, with each chapter constituting a part that could be removed from the binder.
          Until 1989, replacement parts were identified by the words REPLACEMENT PART, preceded by the year of publication on the first page of each part. Those chapters that were reprinted, but were not replacement parts because they contained no new material, were identified by the designation, “(19:___ reprint),” indicating the year in which they were reprinted.
          The first softcover edition of Oregon Revised Statutes was published in 1989. The 2011 edition of Oregon Revised Statutes consists of 21 softbound volumes.
          A Table of Titles and a Table of Titles and Chapters, covering all 17 volumes of the statute text, follow this Preface. Each volume begins with a Table of Titles and Chapters of the statutes contained in that volume. A chapter outline precedes each chapter and lists the ORS sections and certain temporary provisions compiled in that chapter.
          Chapters that have been entirely repealed or renumbered are no longer listed in the Tables of Titles and Chapters, but a page identifying each of those chapters and indicating the disposition of the former content of the chapter is in the appropriate place in the statute text.
          In addition to the statutes, Oregon Revised Statutes contains the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure, printed pursuant to ORS 1.750. The rules appear in Volume 1 immediately preceding ORS chapter 12.
          Compilation of 2011 regular session Acts. The 17 volumes of statute text contain, with some exceptions, the statute laws of Oregon of a general, public and permanent nature in effect on January 1, 2012 (the normal effective date of the Acts passed by the 2011 regular session of the Seventy-sixth Legislative Assembly). Exceptions arise because not all laws take effect on the usual effective date.
          The text of every statute section compiled in Oregon Revised Statutes is reproduced verbatim from an enrolled Act, with the exception of the changes in form permitted by ORS 173.160 and other changes specifically authorized by law.
          The Legislative Counsel has no general authority to revise; therefore, aside from the authorized changes, the text appearing for the first time in the statute text is not revised in the sense that statutes enacted as a part of House Bill No. 2 of the 1953 session (the so-called “revision bill” by which Oregon Revised Statutes was enacted) were revised. See the Preface to the 1953 edition. The provisions of ORS 174.510 to 174.550, relating to the enactment and construction of the revised statutes enacted by House Bill No. 2, are not applicable to every statute section now compiled in Oregon Revised Statutes.
          The Legislative Counsel has set forth as notes certain temporary material and new material or has retained repealed statutes with notes explaining delayed effective dates. The notes are included to assist the user in placing the permanent law in a clearer context. In some instances, the notes have been given leadlines, which also appear in the chapter outline. Additional notes indicate special effective dates, special temporary provisions or temporary versions of permanent law. Notes are deleted in subsequent editions when they are no longer useful.
          Changes in text of Acts. A number of the types of changes made in the text of enrolled Acts for publication in Oregon Revised Statutes are explained and illustrated below.
          (1) Changes made pursuant to general authority granted by ORS 173.160:
          (a) ORS numbers are assigned to codified session law sections. For example, section 2, chapter 253, Oregon Laws 2009, is compiled as ORS 267.387.
          (b) Long sections of session laws may be divided into several shorter ORS sections. For example, section 240, chapter 16, Oregon Laws 1985, is compiled as the series ORS 816.040 to 816.290.
          (c) Several sections of session laws may be combined in one ORS section. For example, sections 1, 2, and 3, chapter 896, Oregon Laws 2009, are compiled as ORS 276.055.
          (d) Existing ORS sections are assigned new ORS numbers if reorganization of the material is warranted. For example, 418.035 was renumbered to 412.001 in 2007.
          (e) Actual effective dates are inserted in place of “the effective date of this Act.” For example, “the effective date of this 2003 Act” was replaced by “August 29, 2003” in section 4, chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003, compiled as ORS 238A.070.
          (f) References in session laws to “this (year) Act” or to a section of the session laws are replaced by specific ORS references. For example, in section 23, chapter 179, Oregon Laws 2009, amending ORS 125.015, the words “sections 1 to 22 of this 2009 Act” are replaced by “ORS 125.800 to 125.852” and the words “section 2 of this 2009 Act” are replaced by “ORS 125.802.”
          (g) Alterations are made in unamended ORS sections containing references to a specific series of ORS sections when new session law sections were “added to and made a part of” that ORS series. For example, “ORS 517.952 to 517.987.” (emphasis added) cited in ORS 517.986 in the 1993 edition was expanded to “ORS 517.952 to 517.989” (emphasis added) in the 1995 edition to accommodate section 2, chapter 503, Oregon Laws 1995, which was added to and made a part of ORS 517.952 to 517.987, but which could not be accommodated numerically within the existing series.
          (h) Alterations are made in unamended ORS sections when new session law sections are enacted “in lieu of” repealed ORS sections or when ORS sections were renumbered, and such unamended ORS sections contain references to the repealed or renumbered ORS sections. For example, “414.844” was substituted for “735.724” in ORS 735.714 when ORS 735.724 was renumbered ORS 414.844 in 2009.
          (2) Changes made pursuant to specific statutes. Alterations are made in unamended ORS sections pursuant to specific statutes directing the substitution of new words or phrases for existing words or phrases. For example, section 2, chapter 762, Oregon Laws 2009, authorized the substitution of “Oregon University System” for “Department of Higher Education” in Oregon Revised Statutes. A complete list of statutes authorizing substitutions of this nature appears as a note at the end of this Preface.
          “Not added to and made a part of.” Notes may indicate that a particular ORS section was not added to and made a part of the ORS chapter or series in which the section appears. These notes mean that the placement of the section was editorial and not by legislative action. Notes also are used when the series references are either too numerous or too complex to bear further adjustment. However, the note does not mean that the section not added to a series or a chapter is any less the law. The note is intended only to remind the user that definitions, penalties and other references to the series should be examined carefully to determine whether they apply to the noted section.
          For example, Oregon Revised Statutes contains chapter 137 relating to judgment, execution, parole and probation. A law relating to any of those subjects may be enacted but not legislatively added to ORS chapter 137, even though the section clearly belongs with the related materials found in that chapter. The Legislative Counsel compiles the section where it logically belongs and provides the “not added to” note.
          Classification and arrangement. One of the fundamental tasks in code compilation is the maintenance of a sound classification system. Proper classification, by which the laws or parts of laws are brought together in logical consecutive units, is vital for a number of reasons. Classification makes the law more accessible and understandable. Only through classification can all conflicts, implied repeals and duplications be discovered and the proper “revision” legislation enacted. Classification makes possible improvements in the numbering system, the index and the annotations.
          In the process of the initial classification for Oregon Revised Statutes, the statutes were divided into four main codes; the codes, in turn, were divided into titles and the titles into chapters. In each of the codes, an attempt has been made to arrange the titles, and the chapters within titles, in the most logical sequence. The four main codes are as follows:
          (1) Volume 1 contains the remedial code, dealing with court structure and organization and remedies (ORS chapters 1 to 55) and the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.
          (2) Volumes 2 and 3 contain the commercial and civil codes, dealing with corporations and other private legal entities, commercial transactions and relationships between individuals (ORS chapters 56 to 130).
          (3) Volume 4 contains the penal code, dealing with criminal procedure, crimes generally and punishment (ORS chapters 131 to 170).
          (4) Volumes 5 through 17 contain the political code, dealing with the structure and organization of state and local government and with the services rendered and the regulation exercised by government (ORS chapters 171 to 838).
          The basic unit of classification is the chapter. Each chapter is intended to include all the statutes relating to each subject that logically can be treated as a unit. The arrangement of chapters within a title is intended to lead from the general to the specific or to deal with equally important but distinct legislation.
          The arrangement of sections within each chapter is intended to follow a logical pattern. If there are definitions applicable to a whole chapter, they are contained in the first section (or sections) of the chapter. Next comes a section (or sections) stating the leading principle of the chapter. Following this, the details dealing with carrying out or enforcing the principle are set forth. If it is contemplated that certain steps shall be taken in a chronological order, the steps are arranged in that order. If a chapter consists of several independent or separable laws, the sections dealing with each law are arranged according to the pattern just described. In most chapters, except those in the penal code (Volume 4), criminal penalties, and often civil penalties, for violating provisions of a chapter are contained in the last section or sections of the chapter.
          Appointment and designation lists. Lists of appointments required to be made or recommended by legislative leadership and appointments confirmed by the Senate follow the chapter 171 outline. A list of official designations, such as the beaver as the official animal of the State of Oregon, follow the chapter 186 outline.
          Numbering system. Under the decimal system adopted for Oregon Revised Statutes, the number to the left of the decimal point indicates the number of the chapter in which the section is located, while the number to the right indicates the relative position of the section within the chapter. The chapters are numbered progressively with Arabic numerals, but some chapters also contain an alphabetic reference, e.g., ORS chapter 72A. A progressive rather than a consecutive system has been used in order that additional chapters may be inserted in future editions without renumbering existing chapters. The sections are also numbered with the same progressive system.
          Legislative history: source notes. The legislative history of each section subsequent to its enactment as a part of the 1953 revision bill, as well as the legislative history of every new section, is noted in brackets at the end of the section. The pre-1953 history is contained in a softcover pamphlet that is part of the complete edition of Oregon Revised Statutes. Source notes for sections that are repealed, amended or renumbered and new sections that are enacted are indicated as follows:
          (1) Repealed sections. The number “657.222” followed by “[1983 c.528 §8; repealed by 2009 c.11 §83]” means that ORS 657.222 was enacted by Oregon Laws 1983, chapter 528, section 8, and was repealed by Oregon Laws 2009, chapter 11, section 83. Repealed numbers are never used in any subsequent edition.
          (2) Amended sections. (a) The source note “[Amended by 2010 c.98 §1]” following the text of ORS 171.010 means that ORS 171.010 was enacted prior to the 1953 revision and was amended by Oregon Laws 2010, chapter 98, section 1.
          (b) The source note “[1979 c.806 §1; 1981 s.s. c.3 §124; repealed by 1985 c.502 §28]” following the number “135.053” means that ORS 135.053 was enacted by Oregon Laws 1979, chapter 806, section 1; amended by Oregon Laws 1981 (special session), chapter 3, section 124; and then repealed by Oregon Laws 1985, chapter 502, section 28.
          (3) Renumbered sections. The legislative history of a renumbered ORS section for the period before the renumbering of the section is found under the original ORS section number. The legislative history of the section for the period after the renumbering is found following the text of the renumbered section. For example, the number “184.202” followed by “[1989 c.533 §1; renumbered 285.095 in 1991]” means that ORS 184.202 was enacted by Oregon Laws 1989, chapter 533, section 1, and was subsequently renumbered as ORS 285.095 in 1991. (Beginning with the 1989 edition, source notes for renumbered sections indicate the year of the renumbering.) The source note “[Formerly 91.766; 1997 c.249 §31]” following the text of ORS 90.310 means that ORS 90.310 is a renumbered section that was formerly numbered ORS 91.766 and after renumbering, ORS 90.310 was amended by Oregon Laws 1997, chapter 249, section 31. For legislative history before the renumbering, consult the original or earlier numbers.
          (4) New sections. The source note “[1991 c.630 §1; 2009 c.595 §94]” following the text of ORS 137.227 means that ORS 137.227 was enacted by Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 630, section 1, and amended by Oregon Laws 2009, chapter 595, section 94.
          Most new ORS sections are not expressly enacted “in lieu of” statutes superseded by them, so the source notes following the text of such new sections reveal only the formal legislative history. The user may refer to the Act that created the section, or to the Comparative Section Tables in Volume 20, and determine whether that Act also repealed other ORS sections. These repealed ORS sections may have related to the same subject as the newer section and may lead the user to useful annotations.
 
          (5) Repeals with enactments in lieu. In cases where an ORS section has been enacted “in lieu of” a repealed ORS section, the source note following the text of the existing section will so indicate. For example, the source note following the text of ORS 9.260 reads “[Amended by 1953 c.604 §1; 1979 c.252 §21; repealed by 1989 c.1052 §7 (9.261 enacted in lieu of 9.260)].” Reference to former ORS 9.260 in the 1987 Replacement Part shows that it related to the same subject as ORS 9.261, and further reference to the appropriate volume of annotations discloses numerous notes of cases pertaining to former ORS 9.260 that are still relevant to ORS 9.261.
          (6) Referred measures. In some instances, the amendment or repeal of a section does not become operative because the amendatory or repealing Act was referred to and rejected by the people. Consequently, the amendment does not become operative and is not compiled as part of the text. This fact will be indicated in the Comparative Section Tables (Volume 20) as a note. For example, “Note: Chapter 906, Oregon Laws 1989, was referred by the electors and not approved.”
          Finding former law. The user who is interested in the text of an ORS section prior to its amendment or repeal should consult the chapter as it appeared in the preceding edition of Oregon Revised Statutes or the appropriate volume of Oregon Laws (session laws) for the year in which the change was made. For example, the source note to ORS 58.410, “[1987 c.94 §6; 1989 c.383 §2; 1991 c.132 §2; 1999 c.362 §§2,2a]” shows that ORS 58.410 was amended in 1989, 1991 and 1999. The text of ORS 58.410 as it read prior to the 1999 amendment can be found in ORS chapter 58 (1997 Edition). The 1997 text, as affected by the 1999 amendments, can be found in Oregon Laws 1999, chapter 362, sections 2 and 2a, where the new material is shown in boldfaced type and the deleted material is shown in bracketed italic type.
          Citation of Oregon Revised Statutes. This publication should be cited as “Oregon Revised Statutes” (or “ORS”). Individual sections may be cited by using the designation “ORS” followed by the section number. No other citation is necessary. Numbered paragraphs within a section are referred to within the section as subsections, lettered paragraphs as paragraphs. In other ORS sections, subsections and paragraphs are cited as ORS 619.026 (2)(b).
          As defined in ORS 174.100, the word “to” means “to and including” when used in references to a series of statute sections, subsections or paragraphs. A reference to the series ORS 758.505 to 758.555 includes both ORS 758.505 and 758.555.
          Method and form of publication. The complete set (21 volumes) of 2011 Oregon Revised Statutes consists of 17 volumes containing statute text, two volumes containing the General Index, one volume containing the Comparative Section Tables and one volume containing the Annotations annual cumulative supplement. In addition, the set includes one hardcover volume containing the Annotations 1971 Permanent Edition and one volume containing the softcover 1953 Edition Prior Legislative History.
          Statute text in Oregon Revised Statutes is not interrupted by the insertion of annotations or cross-references between statute sections. An additional reason for separating the text and the annotations is to avoid the expense of reprinting the complete annotation material each time the statute text is brought up to date.
