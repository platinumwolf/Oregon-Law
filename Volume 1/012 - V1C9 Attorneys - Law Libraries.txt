Any other person in the executive or legislative department of state government who is otherwise qualified may serve on the board of governors.
      (2) The board of governors shall divide the State of Oregon into regions for the purpose of determining eligibility to be a candidate for the board of governors, eligibility to be elected or appointed to the board of governors, and eligibility to vote in board of governors elections. The regions shall be based on the number of attorneys who have their principal offices in the region. To the extent that it is reasonably possible, the regions shall be configured by the board so that the representation of board members to attorney population in each region is equal to the representation provided in other regions. At least once every 10 years the board shall review the number of attorneys in the regions and shall alter or add regions as the board determines is appropriate in seeking to attain the goal of equal representation.
      (3) Members of the board of governors may be elected only by the active members of the Oregon State Bar who maintain their principal offices in the regions established by the board. The regular term of a member of the board is four years. The board may establish special terms for positions that are shorter than four years for the purpose of staggering the terms of members of the board. The board must identify a position with a special term before accepting statements of candidacy for the region in which the position is located. The board shall establish rules for determining which of the elected members for a region is assigned to the position with a special term.
      (4) No judge of a municipal, state or federal court or any other full-time judicial officer, shall be eligible for appointment or election to the board of governors.
      (5) The term of any member of the board of governors shall terminate on the date of the death or resignation of the member, or if the member of the board is required to be a member of the Oregon State Bar, the term terminates on the date:
      (a) Of the termination of active membership in the Oregon State Bar for any reason;
      (b) When the member discontinues to maintain the principal office of law practice in the region in which it was maintained at the time of the appointment or election of the member; or
      (c) When the member assumes office as a judge of a municipal, state or federal court, or fills a full-time judicial office.

      (2)(a) The executive director shall mail ballots containing the names of the candidates for the office of governor in each region to every active member in the region. Ballots may be delivered in person or by mail to the executive director, but must be received by the executive director on or before the day of the election. The executive director shall canvass the votes and record the results of the election.
      (b) The board by rule may provide for electronic elections in lieu of using mailed ballots under paragraph (a) of this subsection. Rules adopted under this paragraph may provide for electronic distribution of election materials and electronic tabulation of votes.
      (3) In a region in which only one position is to be filled, the candidate receiving the highest vote shall be declared elected. If a region has more than one position to be filled, the candidate with the most votes received shall be declared elected, the candidate with the next highest number of votes received shall then be declared elected, and so on until all positions are filled. The balloting shall be conducted so that only eligible active members can vote, and the secrecy of the ballot shall be preserved.
      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the board may not conduct an election for a region if the number of candidates for the region is equal to or less than the number of open positions for the region.

      (5) The board of governors shall establish procedures for the implementation of subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

      (6) This section provides the exclusive procedure for challenging the eligibility of a candidate for the board. No other administrative or judicial proceeding may be brought to challenge the eligibility of a candidate for the board. [1993 c.307 §3; 2011 c.303 §4]

If the governor does not resign within 10 days after the date the notice is served, the executive director shall mail ballots to each active member of the bar within the region eligible to vote, submitting the question whether the governor shall be recalled.

      9.080 Duties of board of governors; professional liability fund; quorum; status of employees of bar. (1) The state bar shall be governed by the board of governors, except as provided in ORS 9.136 to 9.155. The board is charged with the executive functions of the state bar and shall at all times direct its power to the advancement of the science of jurisprudence and the improvement of the administration of justice. It shall have the authority to adopt, alter, amend and repeal bylaws and to adopt new bylaws containing provisions for the regulation and management of the affairs of the state bar not inconsistent with law.
      (2)(a) The board shall have the authority to require all active members of the state bar engaged in the private practice of law whose principal offices are in Oregon to carry professional liability insurance and shall be empowered, either by itself or in conjunction with other bar organizations, to do whatever is necessary and convenient to implement this provision, including the authority to own, organize and sponsor any insurance organization authorized under the laws of the State of Oregon and to establish a lawyer’s professional liability fund. This fund shall pay, on behalf of active members of the state bar engaged in the private practice of law whose principal offices are in Oregon, all sums as may be provided under such plan which any such member shall become legally obligated to pay as money damages because of any claim made against such member as a result of any act or omission of such member in rendering or failing to render professional services for others in the member’s capacity as an attorney or caused by any other person for whose acts or omissions the member is legally responsible. The board shall have the authority to assess each active member of the state bar engaged in the private practice of law whose principal office is in Oregon for contributions to such fund, to establish definitions of coverage to be provided by such fund and to retain or employ legal counsel to represent such fund and defend and control the defense against any covered claim made against such member. The board shall have the further authority to offer optional professional liability coverage on an underwritten basis above the minimum required coverage limits provided under such fund, either through such fund, through a separate fund or through any insurance organization authorized under the laws of the State of Oregon, and may do whatever is necessary and convenient to implement this provision. Any fund so established shall not be subject to the Insurance Code of the State of Oregon. Records of a claim against the fund are exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.410 to 192.505.
      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, an attorney is not engaged in the private practice of law if the attorney is a full-time employee of a corporation other than a corporation incorporated under ORS chapter 58, the state, an agency or department thereof, a county, city, special district or any other public or municipal corporation or any instrumentality thereof. However, an attorney who practices law outside of the attorney’s full-time employment is engaged in the private practice of law.
      (c) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the principal office of an attorney is considered to be the location where the attorney engages in the private practice of law more than 50 percent of the time engaged in that practice. In the case of an attorney in a branch office outside Oregon and the main office to which the branch office is connected is in Oregon, the principal office of the attorney is not considered to be in Oregon unless the attorney engages in the private practice of law in Oregon more than 50 percent of the time engaged in the private practice of law.

The option, once exercised by written notification directed to the Public Employees Retirement Board, may not be revoked subsequently, except as may otherwise be provided by law. Upon receipt of such notification by the Public Employees Retirement Board, an employee of the state bar who would otherwise, but for the exemption provided in this subsection, be considered an “employee,” as the term is defined in the public employees’ retirement laws, shall be so considered. The state bar and its employees shall be exempt from the provisions of the State Personnel Relations Law. No member of the state bar shall be considered an “employee” as the term is defined in the public employees’ retirement laws, the unemployment compensation laws and the State Personnel Relations Law solely by reason of membership in the state bar.

ATTORNEY AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIP
 
      9.310 Attorney defined; counsel. An attorney is a person authorized to represent a party in the written proceedings in any action, suit or proceeding, in any stage thereof. An attorney, other than the one who represents the party in the written proceedings, may also represent a party in court, or before a judicial officer, in which case the attorney is known as counsel, and the authority of the attorney is limited to the matters that transpire in the court or before such officer at the time.
 
      9.320 Necessity for employment of attorney; effect of employment. Any action, suit, or proceeding may be prosecuted or defended by a party in person, or by attorney, except that the state or a corporation appears by attorney in all cases, unless otherwise specifically provided by law. Where a party appears by attorney, the written proceedings must be in the name of the attorney, who is the sole representative of the client of the attorney as between the client and the adverse party, except as provided in ORS 9.310. [Amended by 1975 c.451 §171]
 
      9.330 Authority of attorney. An attorney has authority to bind the attorney’s client in any of the proceedings in an action, suit or proceeding, by the attorney and client agreement, filed with the clerk or entered in the appropriate record of the court. The attorney also has authority to receive money or property claimed by the client in an action, suit or proceeding, during the pendency thereof, or within three years after judgment, and upon the payment or delivery thereof to discharge the claim or acknowledge satisfaction of the judgment. This section does not prevent a party from employing a new attorney to issue execution upon a judgment or to take other proceedings prescribed by law for its enforcement, and when the party does so, the authority of the former attorney ceases. [Amended by 1985 c.540 §23; 2003 c.576 §277]
 
      9.340 Challenge by party of attorney’s authority to appear for party. If it is alleged by a party for whom an attorney appears that the attorney does so without authority, and the allegation is verified by the affidavit of the party, the court may, if it finds the allegation true, at any stage of the proceedings relieve the party for whom the attorney has assumed to appear from the consequences of the attorney’s acts.
 
      9.350 Challenge of attorney’s authority to appear for adverse party. The court or judge thereof may, on motion of either party and on showing reasonable grounds therefor, require the attorney for an adverse party to prove the authority under which the attorney appears, and until the attorney does so, may stay all proceedings by the attorney on behalf of the party for whom the attorney assumes to appear.
 
      9.360 Compelling delivery by attorney of money or papers. When an attorney refuses to deliver over money or papers to a person from whom or for whom the attorney has received them in the course of professional employment, the attorney may be required by an order of the court in which a judicial proceeding was prosecuted or defended, or if none were prosecuted or defended, then by an order of the circuit court or judge thereof for the county where such attorney resides or may be found, to do so within a specified time, or show cause why the attorney should not be punished for a contempt.
 
      9.370 Compelling delivery when attorney claims lien. If an attorney claims a lien, under the provisions of ORS 87.430, upon the money or papers subject to delivery under ORS 9.360, the court shall:
      (1) Impose, as a condition of making the order, the requirement that the client give security, in form and amount to be directed, to satisfy the lien when determined in an action or suit;
      (2) Summarily inquire into the facts on which the claim of a lien is founded, and determine the same; or
      (3) Direct the trial of the controversy by a jury, or refer it, and upon the verdict or report, determine the same as in other cases. [Amended by 1975 c.648 §70; 1991 c.67 §2; 2003 c.14 §9]
 
      9.380 Changing attorneys and terminating attorney-client relationship. (1) The attorney in an action or proceeding may be changed, or the relationship of attorney and client terminated, as follows:
      (a) Before judgment or final determination, upon the consent of the attorney filed with the clerk or entered in the appropriate record of the court; or
      (b) At any time, upon the order of the court, based on the application of the client or the attorney, for good and sufficient cause.
      (2) The relationship of attorney and client may be terminated after the entry of a judgment or other final determination in an action or proceeding by the filing of a notice of termination of the relationship in the action or proceeding. The notice must be signed by the attorney and must state that all services required of the attorney under the agreement between the attorney and the client have been provided. [Amended by 1985 c.540 §24; 2003 c.576 §278; 2011 c.60 §1]
 
      9.390 Notice of change or termination. When an attorney is changed, or the relationship of attorney and client is terminated, as provided in ORS 9.380, written notice of the change or termination shall be given to the adverse party. Until the notice is given, the adverse party is bound to recognize the former attorney. [Amended by 2011 c.60 §2]

Such rules shall be binding upon all members of the bar.
      (2) A court of this state may not order that evidence be suppressed or excluded in any criminal trial, grand jury proceeding or other criminal proceeding, or order that any criminal prosecution be dismissed, solely as a sanction or remedy for violation of a rule of professional conduct adopted by the Supreme Court. [Amended by 1995 c.302 §19; 1995 c.708 §2]

      9.505 Payment for referring claims resulting from personal injury or death. No person shall offer or promise payment of money or other consideration, or accept any offer or promise of payment of money or other consideration, nor shall any person pay or accept money or other consideration, for referring to an attorney any claim for damage resulting from personal injury or death.

      9.520 Acceptance and prosecution of solicited claims.

      9.529 Status of proceedings relating to discipline, admission or reinstatement. Bar proceedings relating to discipline, admission and reinstatement are neither civil nor criminal in nature. They are sui generis and within the inherent power of the Supreme Court to control. The grounds for denying any applicant admission or reinstatement or for the discipline of attorneys set forth in ORS 9.005 to 9.755 are not intended to limit or alter the inherent power of the Supreme Court to deny any applicant admission or reinstatement to the bar or to discipline a member of the bar.
