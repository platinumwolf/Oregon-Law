If the record of any judgment or other proceeding of any judicial court of this state, or any part of the record of any judicial proceeding, is lost or destroyed, any party or person interested may, on application, by petition in writing under oath to the court and on showing to its satisfaction that the record has been lost or destroyed without fault or neglect of the applicant, obtain an order from the court authorizing the defect to be supplied by a certified copy of the original record when it can be obtained. The certified copy shall have the same effect as the original record. [Amended by 2003 c.576 §274]
 
      7.150 Order of restoration when no copy available. If the loss or destruction of any record or part thereof as mentioned in ORS 7.140 has happened and the defect cannot be supplied as therein provided, any party or person interested may make a written application to the court, to which the record belonged, verified by affidavit showing its loss or destruction and that certified copies cannot be obtained by the applicant. It shall also show the substance of the record and that its loss or destruction occurred without the fault or neglect of the applicant. Thereupon the court shall cause the application to be entered of record in the court, and due notice of it shall be given as in actions at law, that it will be heard by the court. If, upon the hearing, the court shall be satisfied that the statements contained in the written application are true, it shall make an order reciting what was the substance and effect of the lost or destroyed record. This order shall be entered of record in the court, and have the same effect which the original record would have had so far as concerns the applicant and the persons who shall have been notified as herein provided. The record in all cases when the proceeding was in rem, and no personal service was had, may be supplied upon like notice as nearly as may be as in the original proceeding. The court in which the application is pending may in all cases in which publication is required direct, by order, to be entered of record, the form of the notice, and designate the newspaper or newspapers in which it shall be published.
 
      7.160 Restoration of destroyed probate records. In case of the destruction of the records or any part thereof of any court having probate jurisdiction, the judge of the court may proceed, upon the motion of the judge or upon application in writing of any party in interest, to restore the records, papers and proceedings of the court relating to the estate of a deceased person, including recorded wills and wills probated or filed for probate in the court. For this purpose the judge may cause citations to be issued to any parties designated by the judge, and the judge may compel the attendance in court of witnesses whose testimony may be necessary to the establishment of the record or part thereof. The judge may also compel the production of written or documentary evidence which the judge deems necessary in determining the true import and effect of the original record, will, paper or other document belonging to the files of the court. The judge may also make orders and judgments establishing the original record, will, paper, document or proceeding, or its substance, as to the judge shall seem just and proper. The judge may make all rules and regulations governing the proceedings for the restoration as in the judgment of the judge will best secure the rights and protect the interest of all parties concerned. [Amended by 2003 c.576 §275]
 
      7.170 When copy of higher court record may be filed in lower court; effect when original is lost or destroyed. In case of the loss or destruction of the original record of any cause removed to the Supreme Court or to the Court of Appeals, a certified copy of the record of the cause remaining in the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals may be filed in the court from which the cause was removed, on motion of any interested party or person. The copy filed shall have the same effect as the original record would have had if it had not been lost or destroyed. [Amended by 1969 c.198 §35]

      (2) All paper filings in the courts of this state, including all pleadings, motions, copies and other documents, shall be printed on recycled paper if recycled paper is readily available at a reasonable price. The State Court Administrator and the courts of this state shall encourage persons who make paper filings in the courts to use recycled paper that has the highest available content of post-consumer waste, as defined in ORS 279A.010, and that is recyclable in office paper recycling programs in the community in which the filing is made.
