      10.090 Prohibited acts by employers against jurors; notice to jurors; remedy for violations.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 652.610 (3), if, following an election described in subsection (1) of this section, an employer is required or elects to pay any part of the costs of providing health, disability, life or other insurance coverage for the employee that should have been paid by the employee, the employer may deduct from the employee’s pay such amounts upon the employee’s return to work until the amount the employer advanced toward the payments is paid. The total amount deducted for insurance under this subsection may not exceed 10 percent of the employee’s gross pay each pay period.
      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 652.610 (3), if the employer pays any part of the costs of providing health, disability, life or other insurance coverage for an employee under subsection (2) of this section, and the employee ceases to work for the employer before the total amount the employer advanced toward the payments is paid, the employer may deduct the remaining amounts from any amounts owed by the employer to the employee or may seek to recover those amounts by any other legal means.
      (4) An employee who alleges a violation of this section may bring a civil action under ORS 659A.885 or may file a complaint with the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries in the manner provided by ORS 659A.820. [2011 c.118 §2]
 
      10.095 Duty of jury; instructions. The jury, subject to the control of the court, in the cases specified by statute, are the judges of the effect or value of evidence addressed to them, except when it is thereby declared to be conclusive. They are, however, to be instructed by the court on all proper occasions:
      (1) That their power of judging of the effect of evidence is not arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal discretion, and in subordination to the rules of evidence;
      (2) That they are not bound to find in conformity with the declarations of any number of witnesses, which do not produce conviction in their minds, against a less number, or against a presumption or other evidence satisfying their minds;
      (3) That a witness false in one part of the testimony of the witness is to be distrusted in others;
      (4) That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be viewed with distrust, and the oral admissions of a party with caution;
      (5) That in civil cases the affirmative of the issue shall be proved, and when the evidence is contradictory, the finding shall be according to the preponderance of evidence;
      (6) That in criminal cases a person is innocent of a crime or wrong until the prosecution proves otherwise, and guilt shall be established beyond reasonable doubt;
      (7) That evidence is to be estimated, not only by its own intrinsic weight, but also according to the evidence which it is in the power of one side to produce and of the other to contradict; and, therefore,
      (8) That if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is offered when it appears that stronger and more satisfactory was within the power of the party, the evidence offered should be viewed with distrust. [Formerly 17.250]
 
      10.100 View of premises by jury. Whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is proper that the jury should have a view of real property which is the subject of the litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may order the jury to be conducted in a body, in the custody of a proper officer, to the place, which shall be shown to them by the judge or by a person appointed by the court for that purpose. While the jury are thus absent, no person, other than the judge or person so appointed, shall speak to them on any subject connected with the trial. [Formerly 17.230]
 
      10.105 Jury service term. The length of a jury service term in a county shall be established by the presiding judge for the judicial district, but no trial juror shall be required to serve more than 10 days unless necessary to complete the trial of an action.

      10.107 Implementation of “one day, one trial” jury service. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall take all reasonable actions necessary to expedite implementation of juror service procedures for circuit courts that will allow a person called for jury service to serve for one day, or for one trial if selected to serve on a trial.

      (b) “Juror with a disability” means a person who is hard of hearing or speech impaired, who is summoned to serve as a juror and whose name is drawn for grand jury or trial jury service.
      (c) “Qualified interpreter” means a person who is readily able to communicate with a juror with a disability, accurately communicate the proceedings to the juror and accurately repeat the statements of the juror.
      (2) The court to which a juror with a disability is summoned, upon written request by the juror and upon a finding by the court that the juror requires the services of a qualified interpreter or the use of an assistive communication device in examination of the juror as to the juror’s qualifications to act as a juror or in performance by the juror of the functions of a juror, shall appoint a qualified interpreter for the juror and shall fix the compensation and expenses of the interpreter and shall provide an appropriate assistive communication device if needed. The compensation and expenses of an interpreter so appointed and the cost of any assistive communication device shall be paid by the public authority required to pay the fees due to the juror.
      (3) An oath or affirmation shall be administered to a qualified interpreter appointed for a juror with a disability, in substance that the interpreter will accurately communicate the proceedings to the juror and accurately repeat the statements of the juror.
      (4) A qualified interpreter appointed for a juror with a disability, or a person operating an assistive communication device for a juror with a disability, shall be present during deliberations by the jury on which the juror serves. An interpreter or person operating an assistive communication device may not participate in the jury deliberations in any manner except to facilitate communication between the juror with a disability and the other jurors or other persons with whom the jurors may communicate, and the court shall so instruct the jury and the interpreter.
      (5) When a juror with a disability serves on a trial jury, the court shall instruct the jury on the presence of the qualified interpreter or person operating an assistive communication device. [1985 c.703 §9; 1989 c.224 §4; 1991 c.750 §6; 2007 c.70 §6; 2007 c.96 §1]

      (2) A public body having custody, possession or control of any list that may be used as a source list for preparation of a master jury list, upon written request by the State Court Administrator, shall make its list available at any reasonable time and, except as otherwise provided in ORS 802.260, without charge to the State Court Administrator for inspection or copying. The public body, upon written request by the State Court Administrator, shall provide a copy of its list for the date and in the form requested to the State Court Administrator.

      (2) The presiding judge for the judicial district may order an additional number of names selected from the master jury list and added to the term jury list in the same manner as the original term jury list is prepared.

The notice need be given only a reasonable time before the day on which the persons summoned are required to attend.

      (5) If a person summoned is unable to complete a juror eligibility form, another person may do it for the person summoned. Another person completing a form shall indicate on the form that the person did so and the reason therefor.
      (6) If a person summoned fails to return a properly completed juror eligibility form as instructed, a judge of the circuit court may direct the person to appear forthwith and properly complete a form. If the person fails to appear as directed, a judge of the circuit court shall order the person to appear and show cause for that failure. If the person fails to appear pursuant to the order or appears and fails to show good cause, the person may be punished for contempt.
      (7) Before or at the time a person summoned reports for jury service, a judge of the circuit court or clerk of court may question the person as to responses to questions on a completed jury eligibility form returned by the person and grounds for any ineligibility of the person to act as a juror. Any pertinent information so acquired shall be noted on the form.
      (8) Review by a judge of the circuit court or clerk of court of a completed juror eligibility form returned by a person summoned satisfies the requirement prescribed in subsection (1) of this section that a person summoned be questioned.
