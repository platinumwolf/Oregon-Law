The Legislative Assembly finds that state funding and operation of the judicial branch can provide for best statewide allocation of governmental resources according to the actual needs of the people and of the judicial branch by establishing an accountable, equitably funded and uniformly administered system of justice for all the people of this state.

A senior judge who retired from a court other than the Supreme Court may be assigned to any state court other than the Supreme Court.
      (3) The assignment of a senior judge shall be made by an order which shall designate the court to which the judge is assigned and the duration of the assignment.

However, a retired judge shall not receive for services as a senior judge during any calendar year a sum of money which when added to the amount of any judicial retirement pay received by the senior judge for the year exceeds the annual salary of a judge of the court from which the senior judge retired. The compensation shall be paid upon the certificate of the senior judge that the services were performed for the number of days shown in the certificate. Services by a senior judge under an assignment and receipt of compensation for services shall not reduce or otherwise affect the amount of any retirement pay to which the senior judge otherwise would be entitled.

      (6) Documents filed with or prepared by the Chief Justice under subsections (2), (3) and (5) of this section shall not be public records unless received as competent evidence in the course of a hearing pursuant to ORS 1.310 (4) or 1.420. [1987 c.520 §1]

Upon receipt of a request, the Secretary of State shall transmit to the subject judge a certified copy of the request, with a notice to the effect that, unless the judge files a resignation within 45 days after the date of the notice, an investigation will be made to determine whether the judge has a disability. The certified copy and notice shall be served on the subject judge, either by delivering them to the judge in person or by transmitting them by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt to the judge at the last residence address of the judge as shown in the records of the Secretary of State.
      (3) If the subject judge fails to file a resignation within 45 days after the date of the notice, the Secretary of State, within 10 days after the expiration of that period, shall transmit to the Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability certified copies of the request and notice, with a certificate to the effect:
      (a) That the Secretary of State served the notice and copy of the request on the subject judge as provided in subsection (2) of this section; and

      (6) The commission may prescribe rules of procedure for the conduct of the investigation and fix the time and place of the hearing, giving the subject judge due notice thereof. The fees and mileage allowance of witnesses, including experts, shall be fixed by the commission.
      (7) A judge retired under the provisions of this section may not be appointed as judge pro tempore to serve upon any court of the State of Oregon.
      (8) The subject judge may appeal to the Supreme Court from a determination by the commission that the judge has a disability, by filing a notice with the Secretary of State within 10 days after the date of filing of the written findings of fact by the commission. The Secretary of State shall thereupon notify the commission and the Chief Justice. The commission shall forthwith transmit the official record to the Supreme Court, which upon receipt of the record shall have full jurisdiction of the proceeding.
      (9) The Supreme Court shall review the proceeding de novo on the record with authority to affirm, reverse or annul the determination.

If the determination of the commission is affirmed, a decision to that effect shall be filed with the Secretary of State and the office of the subject judge shall forthwith become vacant. Thereupon, the Secretary of State shall certify to the Governor the existence of the vacancy.

      (3) The commission shall adopt rules of procedure governing proceedings under ORS 1.420 and 1.425. [1967 c.294 §10; 1987 c.520 §4]

The judge shall have the right to be present at such hearing, to be represented by counsel, to present testimony and evidence and to cross-examine witnesses.
      (4) If, after hearing or after considering the record and report of the masters, the commission finds that the conduct of the judge justifies censure, suspension or removal from office, the commission shall recommend to the Supreme Court the censure or suspension or removal of the judge.
      (5) The Supreme Court by order may temporarily suspend a judge whose conduct is the subject of proceedings under this section from exercising any judicial functions during the pendency of those proceedings. [1967 c.294 §7; 1971 c.511 §3; 1987 c.520 §5; 1997 c.720 §1]
 
      1.425 Commission proceedings upon receipt of complaint of disability; hearing; physical examination; disposition. (1) Upon complaint from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as provided in ORS 1.303, and after such investigation as the Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability considers necessary, the commission may:
      (a) Proceed as provided in ORS 1.420; or
      (b) If the investigation under this subsection indicates that the subject judge may have a temporary disability, hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to inquire into the alleged disability, or request the Supreme Court to appoint three qualified persons to act as masters, to hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (2) of this section and maintain a record on the matter referred to them and to report to the commission on the alleged disability.
      (2) When a hearing is held by the commission or by masters as authorized in subsection (1)(b) of this section, the hearing shall not be open to the public unless the subject judge requests a public hearing. The testimony and evidence given and received in the hearing shall not be public records. The subject judge shall have the right to be present at such hearing, to be represented by counsel, to present testimony and evidence and to cross-examine witnesses.
      (3)(a) The commission may direct that a subject judge, prior to a hearing, submit to a physical examination by one, two or three physicians licensed to practice in this state and appointed by the commission to conduct the examination, or submit to a mental evaluation by one, two or three physicians, psychologists or other mental health professionals licensed to practice in this state and appointed by the commission to conduct the evaluation, or submit to both that examination and evaluation. The persons appointed to conduct the examination or evaluation shall report thereon to the commission. A copy of any report to the commission shall be provided by the commission to the subject judge. The costs of the examination, evaluation and reporting shall be paid by the commission.
      (b) If a subject judge directed to submit to an examination or evaluation fails to do so, the judge may not present as evidence in the proceeding the results of any medical examination of the judge done at the instance of the judge, and the commission or masters may consider the failure of the judge to submit to examination or evaluation as evidence that the judge has a disability.
      (4) If, after hearing or after considering the record and report of the masters, the commission finds that the subject judge has a temporary disability, the commission may:
      (a) Enter into a disposition of the matter with the subject judge, which may include agreement by the judge to obtain professional counseling, medical treatment or other assistance or to comply with other conditions in respect to the future conduct of the judge and provide for supervision of compliance by the judge and for investigation, hearing as provided in subsection (2) of this section and, if appropriate, action by the commission as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection if the judge fails to comply; or
      (b) If the commission also finds that the conduct of the subject judge justifies suspension, recommend to the Supreme Court that the judge be suspended without loss of salary for a period not exceeding one year.
      (5) The Supreme Court, on its own motion or on recommendation by the commission, by order may temporarily suspend a judge whose alleged disability is involved in proceedings under this section from exercising any judicial functions during the pendency of those proceedings.
      (6) If the commission recommends suspension under subsection (4)(b) of this section, the Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings under this section on the law and facts and may receive additional evidence and permit argument. The Supreme Court may order the judge suspended without loss of salary for a period not exceeding one year. Upon an order of suspension, the judge shall be suspended from office for the period specified in the order. Suspension does not create a vacancy in the office of judge during the period of suspension. In addition to or in lieu of an order of suspension, the Supreme Court may require that the judge obtain professional counseling, medical treatment or other assistance or comply with other conditions in respect to the future conduct of the judge. [1987 c.520 §3]
 
      1.430 Supreme Court review; censure; order of suspension or removal. (1) If a hearing has been held under ORS 1.420, the Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and may receive additional evidence. The Supreme Court may censure the judge or it may order the judge suspended or removed from office.
      (2) If the commission has agreed to allow the judge to submit a consent to censure, suspension or removal, the Supreme Court shall review the stipulation of facts and the disciplinary action to which the judge has consented. If the Supreme Court approves the consent, the court shall censure the judge or order the judge suspended or removed from office pursuant to the terms of the consent. If the Supreme Court rejects the consent and stipulation in full, the court shall remand the matter to the commission for a hearing under ORS 1.420. The hearing shall be conducted as though the consent and stipulation had never been entered into, and the stipulations made by the judge may not be considered as evidence by the commission in the hearing. If the Supreme Court accepts the stipulation of facts but rejects the disciplinary action agreed to by the judge and the commission, the court may remand the matter to the commission for such further fact-finding as the court may direct on the issue of the appropriate discipline for the conduct, and may request that the matter be briefed and argued before the court. The Supreme Court may thereafter censure the judge, or enter an order suspending or removing the judge, as the court finds appropriate under the law and the facts.
      (3) Upon an order for removal, the judge shall be removed from office and the salary of the judge shall cease and the office of the judge is vacant on the date of such order.
      (4) Upon an order of suspension, the judge shall be suspended from office for the period specified in the order and the salary of the judge shall cease, if so ordered, from the date of the order until the end of the specified period. Suspension does not create a vacancy in the office of judge during the period of suspension. [1967 c.294 §7; 1971 c.511 §3; 1997 c.720 §2]
 
      1.440 Status of records of proceedings under ORS 1.420 or 1.425.

      1.450 Status of testimony in proceedings under ORS 1.420 or 1.425.
