SCOPE; CONSTRUCTION; APPLICATION; RULE; CITATION
RULE 1
 
A Scope. These rules govern procedure and practice in all circuit courts of this state, except in the small claims department of circuit courts, for all civil actions and special proceedings whether cognizable as cases at law, in equity, or of statutory origin except where a different procedure is specified by statute or rule. These rules shall also govern practice and procedure in all civil actions and special proceedings, whether cognizable as cases at law, in equity, or of statutory origin, for the small claims department of circuit courts and for all other courts of this state to the extent they are made applicable to such courts by rule or statute. Reference in these rules to actions shall include all civil actions and special proceedings whether cognizable as cases at law, in equity or of statutory origin.
 
B Construction. These rules shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.
 
C Application. These rules, and amendments thereto, shall apply to all actions pending at the time of or filed after their effective date, except to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application in a particular action pending when the rules take effect would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former procedure applies.
 
D “Rule” defined and local rules. References to “these rules” shall include Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure numbered 1 through 85. General references to “rule” or “rules” shall mean only rule or rules of pleading, practice, and procedure established by ORS 1.745, or promulgated under ORS 1.006, 1.735, 2.130, and 305.425, unless otherwise defined or limited. These rules do not preclude a court in which they apply from regulating pleading, practice, and procedure in any manner not inconsistent with these rules.
 
E Use of declaration under penalty of perjury in lieu of affidavit; “declaration” defined. A declaration under penalty of perjury may be used in lieu of any affidavit required or allowed by these rules. A declaration under penalty of perjury may be made without notice to adverse parties, must be signed by the declarant, and must include the following sentence in prominent letters immediately above the signature of the declarant: “I hereby declare that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I understand it is made for use as evidence in court and is subject to penalty for perjury.” As used in these rules, “declaration” means a declaration under penalty of perjury.
 
F Electronic filing. Any reference in these rules to any document, except a summons, which is exchanged, served, entered, or filed during the course of civil litigation shall be construed to include electronic images or other digital information in addition to printed versions of such items, as may be permitted by rules of the court in which the action is pending.
 
G Citation. These rules may be referred to as ORCP and may be cited, for example, by citation of Rule 7, section D, subsection (3), paragraph (a), subparagraph (iv), part (A), as ORCP 7 D(3)(a)(iv)(A).

       D(6)(d) Mailing summons and complaint. If the court orders service by publication and the plaintiff knows or with reasonable diligence can ascertain the defendant's current address, the plaintiff shall mail true copies of the summons and the complaint to the defendant at such address by first class mail and any of the following: certified, registered, or express mail, return receipt requested.

If service cannot be made by another method described in this section because defendants are unknown heirs or persons as described in sections I and J of Rule 20, the action shall proceed against the unknown heirs or persons in the same manner as against named defendants served by publication and with like effect; and any such unknown heirs or persons who have or claim any right, estate, lien, or interest in the property in controversy, at the time of the commencement of the action, and served by publication, shall be bound and concluded by the judgment in the action, if the same is in favor of the plaintiff, as effectively as if the action was brought against such defendants by name.
       D(6)(f) Defending before or after judgment. A defendant against whom publication is ordered or such defendant's representatives, on application and sufficient cause shown, at any time before judgment, shall be allowed to defend the action.

If the defense is successful, and the judgment or any part thereof has been collected or otherwise enforced, restitution may be ordered by the court, but the title to property sold upon execution issued on such judgment, to a purchaser in good faith, shall not be affected thereby.
       D(6)(g) Defendant who cannot be served. Within the meaning of this subsection, a defendant cannot be served with summons by any method authorized by subsection (3) of this section if: (i) service pursuant to subparagraph (4)(a)(i) of this section is not authorized, and the plaintiff attempted service of summons by all of the methods authorized by subsection (3) of this section and was unable to complete service, or (ii) if the plaintiff knew that service by such methods could not be accomplished.

If the defendant is not personally served, the server shall state in the certificate when, where, and with whom true copies of the summons and the complaint were left or describe in detail the manner and circumstances of service.

SERVICE AND FILING OF PLEADINGS AND OTHER PAPERS
RULE 9
 
A Service; when required. Except as otherwise provided in these rules, every order; every pleading subsequent to the original complaint; every written motion other than one which may be heard ex parte; and every written request, notice, appearance, demand, offer of judgment, designation of record on appeal, and similar document shall be served upon each of the parties. No service need be made on parties in default for failure to appear except that pleadings asserting new or additional claims for relief against them shall be served upon them in the manner provided for service of summons in Rule 7.
 
B Service; how made. Whenever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party, and that party is represented by an attorney, the service shall be made upon the attorney unless otherwise ordered by the court. Service upon the attorney or upon a party shall be made by delivering a copy to such attorney or party, by mailing it to such attorney's or party's last known address or, if the party is represented by an attorney, by telephonic facsimile communication device or e-mail as provided in sections F or G of this rule. Delivery of a copy within this rule means: handing it to the person to be served; or leaving it at such person's office with such person's clerk or person apparently in charge thereof; or, if there is no one in charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or, if the office is closed or the person to be served has no office, leaving it at such person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person over 14 years of age then residing therein. A party who has appeared without providing an appropriate address for service may be served by filing a copy of the pleading or other documents with the court. Service by mail is complete upon mailing. Service of any notice or other document to bring a party into contempt may only be upon such party personally.
 
C Filing; proof of service. Except as provided by section D of this rule, all papers required to be served upon a party by section A of this rule shall be filed with the court within a reasonable time after service. Except as otherwise provided in Rule 7 and Rule 8, proof of service of all papers required or permitted to be served may be by written acknowledgment of service, by affidavit or declaration of the person making service, or by certificate of an attorney. Such proof of service may be made upon the papers served or as a separate document attached to the papers. Where service is made by telephonic facsimile communication device or e-mail, proof of service shall be made by affidavit or declaration of the person making service, or by certificate of an attorney or sheriff. Attached to such affidavit, declaration, or certificate shall be the printed confirmation of receipt of the message generated by the transmitting machine, if facsimile communication is used. If service is made by e-mail under section G of this rule, the person making service must certify that he or she received confirmation that the message was received, either by return e-mail, automatically generated message, telephonic facsimile, or orally.
 
D When filing not required. Notices of deposition, requests made pursuant to Rule 43, and answers and responses thereto shall not be filed with the court. This rule shall not preclude their use as exhibits or as evidence on a motion or at trial. Offers of compromise made pursuant to Rule 54 E shall not be filed with the court except as provided in Rule 54 E(3).
 
E Filing with the court defined. The filing of pleadings and other documents with the court as required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court or the person exercising the duties of that office. The clerk or the person exercising the duties of that office shall endorse upon such pleading or document the time of day, the day of the month, the month, and the year. The clerk or person exercising the duties of that office is not required to receive for filing any document unless the name of the court, the title of the cause and the document, the names of the parties, and the attorney for the party requesting filing, if there be one, are legibly endorsed on the front of the document, nor unless the contents thereof are legible.
 
F Service by telephonic facsimile communication device. Whenever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party, and that party is represented by an attorney, the service may be made upon the attorney by means of a telephonic facsimile communication device if the attorney maintains such a device at the attorney's office and the device is operating at the time service is made. Service in this manner shall be equivalent to service by mail for purposes of Rule 10 C.
 
G Service by e-mail. Service by e-mail is prohibited unless attorneys agree in writing to e-mail service. This agreement must provide the names and e-mail addresses of all attorneys and the attorneys' designees, if any, to be served. Any attorney may withdraw his or her agreement at any time, upon proper notice via e-mail and any one of the other methods authorized by this rule. Service is effective under this method when the sender has received confirmation that the attachment has been received by the designated recipient. Confirmation of receipt does not include an automatically generated message that the recipient is out of the office or otherwise unavailable.

TIME
RULE 10
 
A Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by the local rules of any court or by order of court, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday or a legal holiday, including Sunday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday or a legal holiday. If the period so computed relates to serving a public officer or filing a document at a public office, and if the last day falls on a day when that particular office is closed before the end of or for all of the normal work day, the last day shall be excluded in computing the period of time within which service is to be made or the document is to be filed, in which event the period runs until the close of office hours on the next day the office is open for business. When the period of time prescribed or allowed (without regard to section C of this rule) is less than 7 days, intermediate Saturdays and legal holidays, including Sundays, shall be excluded in the computation. As used in this rule, “legal holiday” means legal holiday as defined in ORS 187.010 and 187.020. This section does not apply to any time limitation governed by ORS 174.120.
 
B Unaffected by expiration of term. The period of time provided for the doing of any act or the taking of any proceeding is not affected or limited by the continued existence or expiration of a term of court. The continued existence or expiration of a term of court in no way affects the power of a court to do any act or take any proceeding in any civil action which is pending before it.
 
C Additional time after service by mail. Except for service of summons, whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon such party and the notice or paper is served by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.

There shall be no other pleading unless the court orders otherwise.

A Time for filing motions and pleadings.

C Responding to amended pleading. A party shall respond to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within 10 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise directs.
 
D Enlarging time to plead or do other act. The court may, in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or allow any other pleading or motion after the time limited by the procedural rules, or by an order enlarge such time.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; §A amended by 1979 c.284 §13; §A amended by CCP 12/10/94]
 
FORM OF PLEADINGS
RULE 16
 
A Captions; names of parties. Every pleading shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the court, the title of the action, the register number of the cause, and a designation in accordance with Rule 13 B. In the complaint the title of the action shall include the names of all the parties, but in other pleadings it is sufficient to state the name of the first party on each side with an appropriate indication of other parties.
 
B Concise and direct statement; paragraphs; separate statement of claims or defenses. Every pleading shall consist of plain and concise statements in paragraphs consecutively numbered throughout the pleading with Arabic numerals, the contents of which shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances, and a paragraph may be referred to by number in all succeeding pleadings. Each separate claim or defense shall be separately stated. Within each claim alternative theories of recovery shall be identified as separate counts.
 
C Consistency in pleading alternative statements. Inconsistent claims or defenses are not objectionable, and when a party is in doubt as to which of two or more statements of fact is true, the party may allege them in the alternative. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has, regardless of consistency and whether based upon legal or equitable grounds or upon both. All statements shall be made subject to the obligation set forth in Rule 17.
 
D Adoption by reference. Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; §B amended by CCP 12/8/84; §B amended by CCP 12/13/86]

RULE 17
 
A Signing by party or attorney; certificate. Every pleading, motion and other document of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record who is an active member of the Oregon State Bar. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign the pleading, motion or other document and state the address of the party. Pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit or declaration.
 
B Pleadings, motions and other papers not signed. If a pleading, motion or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant.
 
C Certifications to court.
       C(1) An attorney or party who signs, files or otherwise submits an argument in support of a pleading, motion or other document makes the certifications to the court identified in subsections (2) to (5) of this section, and further certifies that the certifications are based on the person's reasonable knowledge, information and belief, formed after the making of such inquiry as is reasonable under the circumstances.
       C(2) A party or attorney certifies that the pleading, motion or other document is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
       C(3) An attorney certifies that the claims, defenses, and other legal positions taken in the pleading, motion or other document are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.
       C(4) A party or attorney certifies that the allegations and other factual assertions in the pleading, motion or other document are supported by evidence. Any allegation or other factual assertion that the party or attorney does not wish to certify to be supported by evidence must be specifically identified. The attorney or party certifies that the attorney or party reasonably believes that an allegation or other factual assertion so identified will be supported by evidence after further investigation and discovery.
       C(5) The party or attorney certifies that any denials of factual assertion are supported by evidence. Any denial of factual assertion that the party or attorney does not wish to certify to be supported by evidence must be specifically identified. The attorney or party certifies that the attorney or party believes that a denial of a factual assertion so identified is reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
 
D Sanctions.
       D(1) The court may impose sanctions against a person or party who is found to have made a false certification under section C of this rule, or who is found to be responsible for a false certification under section C of this rule. A sanction may be imposed under this section only after notice and an opportunity to be heard are provided to the party or attorney. A law firm is jointly liable for any sanction imposed against a partner, associate or employee of the firm, unless the court determines that joint liability would be unjust under the circumstances.
       D(2) Sanctions may be imposed under this section upon motion of a party or upon the court's own motion. If the court seeks to impose sanctions on its own motion, the court shall direct the party or attorney to appear before the court and show cause why the sanctions should not be imposed. The court may not issue an order to appear and show cause under this subsection at any time after the filing of a voluntary dismissal, compromise or settlement of the action with respect to the party or attorney against whom sanctions are sought to be imposed.
       D(3) A motion by a party to the proceeding for imposition of sanctions under this section must be made separately from other motions and pleadings, and must describe with specificity the alleged false certification. A motion for imposition of sanctions based on a false certification under subsection C(4) of this rule may not be filed until 120 days after the filing of a complaint if the alleged false certification is an allegation or other factual assertion in a complaint filed within 60 days of the running of the statute of limitations for a claim made in the complaint. Sanctions may not be imposed against a party until at least 21 days after the party is served with the motion in the manner provided by Rule 9. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the court may not impose sanctions against a party if, within 21 days after the motion is served on the party, the party amends or otherwise withdraws the pleading, motion, document or argument in a manner that corrects the false certification specified in the motion. If the party does not amend or otherwise withdraw the pleading, motion, document or argument but thereafter prevails on the motion, the court may order the moving party to pay to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees incurred by the prevailing party by reason of the motion for sanctions.
       D(4) Sanctions under this section must be limited to amounts sufficient to reimburse the moving party for attorney fees and other expenses incurred by reason of the false certification, including reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by reason of the motion for sanctions, and upon clear and convincing evidence of wanton misconduct amounts sufficient to deter future false certification by the party or attorney and by other parties and attorneys. The sanction may include monetary penalties payable to the court. The sanction must include an order requiring payment of reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by the moving party by reason of the false certification.
       D(5) An order imposing sanctions under this section must specifically describe the false certification and the grounds for determining that the certification was false. The order must explain the grounds for the imposition of the specific sanction that is ordered.
 
E Rule not applicable to discovery. This rule does not apply to any motion, pleading or conduct that is subject to sanction under Rule 46.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
RULE 18
 
       A pleading which asserts a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third party claim, shall contain:
       A A plain and concise statement of the ultimate facts constituting a claim for relief without unnecessary repetition.
       B A demand of the relief which the party claims; if recovery of money or damages is demanded, the amount thereof shall be stated; relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.

RESPONSIVE PLEADINGS
RULE 19
 
A Defenses; form of denials. A party shall state in short and plain terms the party's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the allegations upon which the adverse party relies. If the party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation, the party shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the allegations denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an allegation, the pleader shall admit so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the allegations of the preceding pleading, the denials may be made as specific denials of designated allegations or paragraphs, or the pleader may generally deny all the allegations except such designated allegations or paragraphs as the pleader expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all of the allegations of the preceding pleading, the pleader may do so by general denial of all allegations of the preceding pleading subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 17.
 
B Affirmative defenses. In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, comparative or contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, unconstitutionality, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.
 
C Effect of failure to deny. Allegations in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damages, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Allegations in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.
 
[CCP 12/2/78]
 
SPECIAL PLEADING RULES
RULE 20
 
A Conditions precedent. In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to allege generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity, and when so made the party pleading the performance or occurrence shall on the trial establish the facts showing such performance or occurrence.
 
B Judgment or other determination of court or officer; how pleaded. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given or made. If such allegation is controverted, the party pleading is bound to establish on the trial the facts conferring jurisdiction.
 
C Private statute; how pleaded. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived therefrom, it is sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of its passage, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof.
 
D Corporate existence of city or county and of ordinances or comprehensive plans generally; how pleaded.
       D(1) In pleading the corporate existence of any city, it shall be sufficient to state in the pleading that the city is existing and duly incorporated and organized under the laws of the state of its incorporation. In pleading the existence of any county, it shall be sufficient to state in the pleading that the county is existing and was formed under the laws of the state in which it is located.
       D(2) In pleading an ordinance, comprehensive plan, or enactment of any county or incorporated city, or a right derived therefrom, in any court, it shall be sufficient to refer to the ordinance, comprehensive plan, or enactment by its title, if any, otherwise by its commonly accepted name or number, and the date of its passage or the date of its approval when approval is necessary to render it effective, and the court shall thereupon take judicial notice thereof. As used in this subsection, “comprehensive plan” has the meaning given that term by ORS 197.015.
 
E Libel or slander action.
       E(1) In an action for libel or slander it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose; but it shall be sufficient to state generally that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff. If such allegation is controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish on the trial that it was so published or spoken.
       E(2) In the answer, the defendant may allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount of damages, and whether the defendant proves the justification or not, the defendant may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
 
F Official document or act. In pleading an official document or official act it is sufficient to allege that the document was issued or the act done in compliance with law.
 
G Recitals and negative pregnants. No allegations in a pleading shall be held insufficient on the grounds that they are pled by way of recital rather than alleged directly. No denial shall be treated as an admission on the ground that it contains a negative pregnant.
 
H Fictitious parties. When a party is ignorant of the name of an opposing party and so alleges in a pleading, the opposing party may be designated by any name, and when such party's true name is discovered, the process and all pleadings and proceedings in the action may be amended by substituting the true name.
 
I Designation of unknown heirs in actions relating to property. When the heirs of any deceased person are proper parties defendant to any action relating to property in this state, and the names and residences of such heirs are unknown, they may be proceeded against under the name and title of the “unknown heirs” of the deceased.
 
J Designation of unknown persons. In any action to determine any adverse claim, estate, lien, or interest in property, or to quiet title to property, the plaintiff may include as a defendant in such action, and insert in the title thereof, in addition to the names of such persons or parties as appear of record to have, and other persons or parties who are known to have, some title, claim, estate, lien, or interest in the property in controversy, the following: “Also all other persons or parties unknown claiming any right, title, lien, or interest in the property described in the complaint herein.”
[CCP 12/2/78]
 
DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS; HOW PRESENTED; BY PLEADING OR MOTION; MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
RULE 21
 
A How presented. Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or third party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion to dismiss: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, (4) that plaintiff has not the legal capacity to sue, (5) insufficiency of summons or process or insufficiency of service of summons or process, (6) that the party asserting the claim is not the real party in interest, (7) failure to join a party under Rule 29, (8) failure to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim, and (9) that the pleading shows that the action has not been commenced within the time limited by statute. A motion to dismiss making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. The grounds upon which any of the enumerated defenses are based shall be stated specifically and with particularity in the responsive pleading or motion. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If, on a motion to dismiss asserting defenses (1) through (7), the facts constituting such defenses do not appear on the face of the pleading and matters outside the pleading, including affidavits, declarations and other evidence, are presented to the court, all parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present affidavits, declarations and other evidence, and the court may determine the existence or nonexistence of the facts supporting such defense or may defer such determination until further discovery or until trial on the merits. If the court grants a motion to dismiss, the court may enter judgment in favor of the moving party or grant leave to file an amended complaint. If the court grants the motion to dismiss on the basis of defense (3), the court may enter judgment in favor of the moving party, stay the proceeding, or defer entry of judgment.
 
B Motion for judgment on the pleadings. After the pleadings are closed, but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.
 
C Preliminary hearings. The defenses specifically denominated (1) through (9) in section A of this rule, whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings mentioned in section B of this rule shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.
 
D Motion to make more definite and certain. Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading, or if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules upon motion by a party within 10 days after service of the pleading, or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment when the allegations of a pleading are so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the charge, defense, or reply is not apparent. If the motion is granted and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after service of the order or within such other time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.
 
E Motion to strike. Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 10 days after the service of the pleading upon such party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken: (1) any sham, frivolous, or irrelevant pleading or defense or any pleading containing more than one claim or defense not separately stated; (2) any insufficient defense or any sham, frivolous, irrelevant, or redundant matter inserted in a pleading.
 
F Consolidation of defenses in motion. A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a motion under this rule, except a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the person or insufficiency of summons or process or insufficiency of service of summons or process, but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subsection G(3) of this rule on any of the grounds there stated. A party may make one motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the person or insufficiency of summons or process or insufficiency of service of summons or process without consolidation of defenses required by this section.
 
G Waiver or preservation of certain defenses.
       G(1) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, insufficiency of summons or process, or insufficiency of service of summons or process, is waived under either of the following circumstances: (a) if the defense is omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in section F of this rule, or (b) if the defense is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading. The defenses referred to in this subsection shall not be raised by amendment.
       G(2) A defense that a plaintiff has not the legal capacity to sue, that the party asserting the claim is not the real party in interest, or that the action has not been commenced within the time limited by statute, is waived if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof. Leave of court to amend a pleading to assert the defenses referred to in this subsection shall only be granted upon a showing by the party seeking to amend that such party did not know and reasonably could not have known of the existence of the defense or that other circumstances make denial of leave to amend unjust.
       G(3) A defense of failure to state ultimate facts constituting a claim, a defense of failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 29, and an objection of failure to state a legal defense to a claim or insufficiency of new matter in a reply to avoid a defense, may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under Rule 13 B or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits. The objection or defense, if made at trial, shall be disposed of as provided in Rule 23 B in light of any evidence that may have been received.
       G(4) If it appears by motion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.

COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, AND THIRD PARTY CLAIMS
RULE 22
 
A Counterclaims.
       A(1) Each defendant may set forth as many counterclaims, both legal and equitable, as such defendant may have against a plaintiff.
       A(2) A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.
 
B Cross-claim against codefendant.
       B(1) In any action where two or more parties are joined as defendants, any defendant may in such defendant's answer allege a cross-claim against any other defendant. A cross-claim asserted against a codefendant must be one existing in favor of the defendant asserting the cross-claim and against another defendant, between whom a separate judgment might be had in the action and shall be: (a) one arising out of the occurrence or transaction set forth in the complaint; or (b) related to any property that is the subject matter of the action brought by plaintiff.
       B(2) A cross-claim may include a claim that the defendant against whom it is asserted is liable, or may be liable, to the defendant asserting the cross-claim for all or part of the claim asserted by the plaintiff.
       B(3) An answer containing a cross-claim shall be served upon the parties who have appeared.
 
C Third party practice.
       C(1) After commencement of the action, a defending party, as a third party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint to be served upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the third party plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against the third party plaintiff as a matter of right not later than 90 days after service of the plaintiff's summons and complaint on the defending party. Otherwise the third party plaintiff must obtain agreement of parties who have appeared and leave of court. The person served with the summons and third party complaint, hereinafter called the third party defendant, shall assert any defenses to the third party plaintiff's claim as provided in Rule 21 and may assert counterclaims against the third party plaintiff and cross-claims against other third party defendants as provided in this rule. The third party defendant may assert against the plaintiff any defenses which the third party plaintiff has to the plaintiff's claim. The third party defendant may also assert any claim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third party plaintiff. The plaintiff may assert any claim against the third party defendant arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third party plaintiff, and the third party defendant thereupon shall assert the third party defendant's defenses as provided in Rule 21 and may assert the third party defendant's counterclaims and cross-claims as provided in this rule. Any party may move to strike the third party claim, or for its severance or separate trial. A third party may proceed under this section against any person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the third party defendant for all or part of the claim made in the action against the third party defendant.
       C(2) A plaintiff against whom a counterclaim has been asserted may cause a third party to be brought in under circumstances which would entitle a defendant to do so under subsection C(1) of this section.
 
D Joinder of additional parties.
       D(1) Persons other than those made parties to the original action may be made parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim in accordance with the provisions of Rules 28 and 29.
       D(2) A defendant may, in an action on a contract brought by an assignee of rights under that contract, join as parties to that action all or any persons liable for attorney fees under ORS 20.097. As used in this subsection “contract” includes any instrument or document evidencing a debt.
       D(3) In any action against a party joined under this section of this rule, the party joined shall be treated as a defendant for purposes of service of summons and time to answer under Rule 7.
 
E Separate trial. Upon motion of any party or on the court's own initiative, the court may order a separate trial of any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third party claim so alleged if to do so would: (1) be more convenient; (2) avoid prejudice; or (3) be more economical and expedite the matter.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; §D amended by 1979 c.284 §17; §A amended by CCP 12/13/80; §C amended by CCP 12/4/82; §C amended by CCP 12/10/94]
 
AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PLEADINGS
RULE 23
 
A Amendments. A pleading may be amended by a party once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. Whenever an amended pleading is filed, it shall be served upon all parties who are not in default, but as to all parties who are in default or against whom a default previously has been entered, judgment may be rendered in accordance with the prayer of the original pleading served upon them; and neither the amended pleading nor the process thereon need be served upon such parties in default unless the amended pleading asks for additional relief against the parties in default.
 
B Amendments to conform to the evidence. When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice such party in maintaining an action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.
 
C Relation back of amendments. Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading. An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action against the party to be brought in by amendment, such party (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining any defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party brought in by amendment.
 
D How amendment made. When any pleading is amended before trial, mere clerical errors excepted, it shall be done by filing a new pleading, to be called the amended pleading, or by interlineation, deletion, or otherwise. Such amended pleading shall be complete in itself, without reference to the original or any preceding amended one.
 
E Supplemental pleadings. Upon motion of a party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit the party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense. If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; §§B,D,E,F,G amended by CCP 12/13/80]
 
JOINDER OF CLAIMS
RULE 24
 
A Permissive joinder. A plaintiff may join in a complaint, either as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims, legal or equitable, as the plaintiff has against an opposing party.
 
B Forcible entry and detainer and rental due. If a claim of forcible entry and detainer and a claim for rental due are joined, the defendant shall have the same time to appear as is provided by rule or statute in actions for the recovery of rental due.
 
C Separate statement. The claims joined must be separately stated and must not require different places of trial.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; amended by 1979 c.284 §18]
 
EFFECT OF PROCEEDING AFTER MOTION OR AMENDMENT
RULE 25
 
A Amendment or pleading over after motion; non-waiver of defenses or objections. When a motion to dismiss or a motion to strike an entire pleading or a motion for a judgment on the pleadings under Rule 21 is allowed, the court may, upon such terms as may be proper, allow the party to amend the pleading. In all cases where part of a pleading is ordered stricken, the pleading shall be amended in accordance with Rule 23 D. By amending a pleading pursuant to this section, the party amending such pleading shall not be deemed thereby to have waived the right to challenge the correctness of the court's ruling.
 
B Amendment of pleading; objections to amended pleading not waived. If a pleading is amended, whether pursuant to sections A or B of Rule 23 or section A of this rule or pursuant to other rule or statute, a party who has filed and received a court's ruling on any motion directed to the preceding pleading does not waive any defenses or objections asserted in such motion by failing to reassert them against the amended pleading.
 
C Denial of motion; non-waiver by filing responsive pleading. If an objection or defense is raised by motion, and the motion is denied, the party filing the motion does not waive the objection or defense by filing a responsive pleading or by failing to re-assert the objection or defense in the responsive pleading or by otherwise proceeding with the prosecution or defense of the action.
 
[CCP 12/13/80]
 
REAL PARTY IN INTEREST; CAPACITY OF PARTNERSHIPS AND ASSOCIATIONS
RULE 26
 
A Real party in interest. Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An executor, administrator, guardian, conservator, bailee, trustee of an express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, or a party authorized by statute may sue in that party's own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought; and when a statute of this state so provides, an action for the use or benefit of another shall be brought in the name of the state. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.
 
B Partnerships and associations. Any partnership or other unincorporated association, whether organized for profit or not, may sue in any name which it has assumed and be sued in any name which it has assumed or by which it is known. Any member of the partnership or other unincorporated association may be joined as a party in an action against the partnership or unincorporated association.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; amended by CCP 12/13/80]
 
MINOR OR INCAPACITATED PARTIES
RULE 27
 
A Appearance of minor parties by guardian or conservator. When a minor, who has a conservator of such minor's estate or a guardian, is a party to any action, such minor shall appear by the conservator or guardian as may be appropriate or, if the court so orders, by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action is brought. If the minor does not have a conservator of such minor's estate or a guardian, the minor shall appear by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court. The court shall appoint some suitable person to act as guardian ad litem:
       A(1) When the minor is plaintiff, upon application of the minor, if the minor is 14 years of age or older, or upon application of a relative or friend of the minor if the minor is under 14 years of age.
       A(2) When the minor is defendant, upon application of the minor, if the minor is 14 years of age or older, filed within the period of time specified by these rules or other rule or statute for appearance and answer after service of summons, or if the minor fails so to apply or is under 14 years of age, upon application of any other party or of a relative or friend of the minor.
 
B Appearance of incapacitated person by conservator or guardian. When a person who is incapacitated or financially incapable, as defined in ORS 125.005, who has a conservator of such person's estate or a guardian, is a party to any action, the person shall appear by the conservator or guardian as may be appropriate or, if the court so orders, by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action is brought. If the person does not have a conservator of such person's estate or a guardian, the person shall appear by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court. The court shall appoint some suitable person to act as guardian ad litem:
       B(1) When the person who is incapacitated or financially incapable, as defined in ORS 125.005, is plaintiff, upon application of a relative or friend of the person.
       B(2) When the person is defendant, upon application of a relative or friend of the person filed within the period of time specified by these rules or other rule or statute for appearance and answer after service of summons, or if the application is not so filed, upon application of any party other than the person.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; amended by 1979 c.284 §19; §B amended by CCP 12/15/90; §B amended by 1995 c.79 §403 and 1995 c.664 §100]
 
JOINDER OF PARTIES
RULE 28
 
A Permissive joinder as plaintiffs or defendants. All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will arise in the action. All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action. A plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief, and against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities.
 
B Separate trials. The court may make such orders as will prevent a party from being embarrassed, delayed, or put to unnecessary expense by the inclusion of a party against whom that party asserts no claim and who asserts no claim against that party. The court may order separate trials or make other orders to prevent delay or prejudice.
 
[CCP 12/2/78]
 
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION
RULE 29
 
A Persons to be joined if feasible. A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in that person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition in that person's absence may (a) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (b) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of their claimed interest. If such person has not been so joined, the court shall order that such person be made a party. If a person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, such person shall be made a defendant, the reason being stated in the complaint.
 
B Determination by court whenever joinder not feasible. If a person as described in subsections A(1) and (2) of this rule cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
 
C Exception of class actions. This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 32.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; amended by 1979 c.284 §20]
 
MISJOINDER AND NONJOINDER OF PARTIES
RULE 30
 
Misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties. Misjoinder of parties is not ground for dismissal of an action. Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just. Any claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately.
 
[CCP 12/2/78]
 
INTERPLEADER
RULE 31
 
A Parties. Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff alleges that plaintiff is not liable in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants. A defendant exposed to similar liability may obtain such interpleader by way of cross-claim or counterclaim. The provisions of this rule supplement and do not in any way limit the joinder of parties otherwise permitted by rule or statute.
 
B Procedure. Any property or amount involved as to which the plaintiff admits liability may, upon order of the court, be deposited with the court or otherwise preserved, or secured by bond in an amount sufficient to assure payment of the liability admitted. The court may thereafter enjoin all parties before it from commencing or prosecuting any other action regarding the subject matter of the interpleader action. Upon hearing, the court may order the plaintiff discharged from liability as to property deposited or secured before determining the rights of the claimants thereto.
 
C Attorney fees. In any suit or action in interpleader filed pursuant to this rule by any party other than a party who has been compensated for acting as a surety with respect to the funds or property interpled, the party filing the suit or action in interpleader shall be awarded a reasonable attorney fee in addition to costs and disbursements upon the court ordering that the funds or property interpled be deposited with the court, secured or otherwise preserved and that the party filing the suit or action in interpleader be discharged from liability as to the funds or property. The attorney fees awarded shall be assessed against and paid from the funds or property ordered interpled by the court.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; amended by 1991 c.733 §1]
 
CLASS ACTIONS
RULE 32
 
A Requirement for class action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if:
       A(1) The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;
       A(2) There are questions of law or fact common to the class;
       A(3) The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;
       A(4) The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; and
       A(5) In an action for damages, the representative parties have complied with the prelitigation notice provisions of section H of this rule.
 
B Class action maintainable. An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of section A of this rule are satisfied, and in addition, the court finds that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to this finding include:
       B(1) The extent to which the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class creates a risk of:
       B(1)(a) Inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or
       B(1)(b) Adjudications with respect to members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;
       B(2) The extent to which the relief sought would take the form of injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole;
       B(3) The extent to which questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members;
       B(4) The interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;
       B(5) The extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class;
       B(6) The desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum;
       B(7) The difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action that will be eliminated or significantly reduced if the controversy is adjudicated by other available means; and
       B(8) Whether or not the claims of individual class members are insufficient in the amounts or interests involved, in view of the complexities of the issues and the expenses of the litigation, to afford significant relief to the members of the class.
 
C Determination by order whether class action to be maintained.
       C(1) As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether and with respect to what claims or issues it is to be so maintained and shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions thereon. An order under this section may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.
       C(2) Where a party has relied upon a statute or law which another party seeks to have declared invalid, or where a party has in good faith relied upon any legislative, judicial, or administrative interpretation or regulation which would necessarily have to be voided or held inapplicable if another party is to prevail in the class action, the court may postpone a determination under subsection (1) of this section until the court has made a determination as to the validity or applicability of the statute, law, interpretation, or regulation.
 
D Dismissal or compromise of class actions; court approval required; when notice required. Any action filed as a class action in which there has been no ruling under subsection C(1) of this rule and any action ordered maintained as a class action shall not be voluntarily dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to some or all members of the class in such manner as the court directs, except that if the dismissal is to be without prejudice or with prejudice against the class representative only, then such dismissal may be ordered without notice if there is a showing that no compensation in any form has passed directly or indirectly from the party opposing the class to the class representative or to the class representative's attorney and that no promise of such compensation has been made. If the statute of limitations has run or may run against the claim of any class member, the court may require appropriate notice.
 
E Court authority over conduct of class actions. In the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders which may be altered or amended as may be desirable:
       E(1) Determining the course of proceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument, including precertification determination of a motion made by any party pursuant to Rules 21 or 47 if the court concludes that such determination will promote the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy and will not cause undue delay;
       E(2) Requiring, for the protection of class members or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct to some or all class members of any step in the action, of the proposed extent of the judgment; of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses or otherwise to come into the action, or to be excluded from the class;
       E(3) Imposing conditions on the representative parties, class members, or intervenors;
       E(4) Requiring that the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent persons, and that the action proceed accordingly; and
       E(5) Dealing with similar procedural matters.
 
F Notice and exclusion.
       F(1) When ordering that an action be maintained as a class action under this rule, the court shall direct that notice be given to some or all members of the class under subsection E(2) of this rule, shall determine when and how this notice should be given and shall determine whether, when, how, and under what conditions putative members may elect to be excluded from the class. The matters pertinent to these determinations ordinarily include: (a) the nature of the controversy and the relief sought; (b) the extent and nature of any member's injury or liability; (c) the interest of the party opposing the class in securing a final resolution of the matters in controversy; (d) the inefficiency or impracticality of separately maintained actions to resolve the controversy; (e) the cost of notifying the members of the class; and (f) the possible prejudice to members to whom notice is not directed. When appropriate, exclusion may be conditioned on a prohibition against institution or maintenance of a separate action on some or all of the matters in controversy in the class action or a prohibition against use in a separately maintained action of any judgment rendered in favor of the class from which exclusion is sought.
       F(2)(i) Prior to the entry of a judgment against a defendant the court shall request members of the class who may be entitled to individual monetary recovery to submit a statement in a form prescribed by the court requesting affirmative relief which may also, where appropriate, require information regarding the nature of the loss, injury, claim, transactional relationship, or damage.
       F(2)(ii) The form of the statement shall be designed to meet the ends of justice. In determining the language and form of the documents to be sent class members under subsection F(2)(i) or (iii), the court shall consider at least: (a) the nature of the acts of the defendant; (b) the amount of knowledge a class member would have about the extent of such member's damages; (c) the nature of the class including the probable degree of sophistication of its members and any special needs created by class members' disabilities; (d) whether it is appropriate for the statement to be prepared in alternative formats, such as large type, Braille, or in languages in addition to English; and (e) the availability of relevant information from sources other than the individual class members.
       F(2)(iii) When the names and addresses of the class members can reasonably be determined from the defendant's business records and individual monetary recoveries are capable of calculation without the need for individualized adjudications, the court, instead of requiring the statement referred to in subsection F(2)(i), may direct the defendant to send each class member notice of (a) the amount of the monetary recovery that has been calculated for that person and (b) that person's right to request exclusion from the class. All class members who do not request exclusion within the time specified by the court shall be deemed to have requested affirmative relief in the calculated amount.
       F(2)(iv) The amount of damages assessed against the defendant shall not exceed the total amount of damages determined to be allowable by the court for all individual class members who have filed the statement required by the court under subsection F(2)(i) or who are deemed to have requested affirmative relief under subsection F(2)(iii), assessable court costs, and an award of attorney fees, if any, as determined by the court.
       F(2)(v) If the parties agree and the court approves, any of the procedures set forth in subsection F(2)(i) to subsection F(2)(iv) may be waived in a particular case.
       F(3) If a class member fails to file the statement required by the court under subsection F(2)(i) or if a class member requests exclusion under subsection F(2)(iii) within the time specified by the court, that person's claim for monetary recovery shall be dismissed without prejudice to the right to maintain an individual, but not a class, action for such claim.
       F(4) Nothing in subsections F(2) or F(3) is intended to allow the court to award any monetary recovery that is not claimed either because a class member failed to file the statement required by the court under subsection F(2)(i), or because a class member requested exclusion under subsection F(2)(iii) within the time specified by the court.
       F(5) Plaintiffs shall bear costs of any notice ordered prior to a determination of liability. The court may, however, order that defendant bear all or a specified part of the costs of any notice included with a regular mailing by defendant to its current customers or employees. The court may hold a hearing to determine how the costs of such notice shall be apportioned.
       F(6) No duty of compliance with due process notice requirements is imposed on a defendant by reason of the defendant including notice with a regular mailing by the defendant to current customers or employees of the defendant under this section.
       F(7) As used in this section, “customer” includes a person, including but not limited to a student, who has purchased services or goods from a defendant.
 
G Commencement or maintenance of class actions regarding particular issues; subclasses. When appropriate an action may be brought or ordered maintained as a class action with respect to particular claims or issues or by or against multiple classes or subclasses. Each subclass must separately satisfy all requirements of this rule except for subsection A(1).
 
H Notice and demand required prior to commencement of action for damages.
       H(1) Thirty days or more prior to the commencement of an action for damages pursuant to the provisions of sections A and B of this rule, the potential plaintiffs' class representative shall:
       H(1)(a) Notify the potential defendant of the particular alleged cause of action; and
       H(1)(b) Demand that such person correct or rectify the alleged wrong.
       H(2) Such notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the place where the transaction occurred, such person's principal place of business within this state, or, in the case of a corporation or limited partnership not authorized to transact business in this state, to the principal office or place of business of the corporation or limited partnership, and to any address the use of which the class representative knows, or on the basis of reasonable inquiry, has reason to believe is most likely to result in actual notice.
 
I Limitation on maintenance of class actions for damages. No action for damages may be maintained under the provisions of sections A and B of this rule upon a showing by a defendant that all of the following exist:
       I(1) All potential class members similarly situated have been identified, or a reasonable effort to identify such other people has been made;
       I(2) All potential class members so identified have been notified that upon their request the defendant will make the appropriate compensation, correction, or remedy of the alleged wrong;
       I(3) Such compensation, correction, or remedy has been, or, in a reasonable time, will be, given; and
       I(4) Such person has ceased from engaging in, or if immediate cessation is impossible or unreasonably expensive under the circumstances, such person will, within a reasonable time, cease to engage in such methods, acts, or practices alleged to be violative of the rights of potential class members.
 
J Application of sections H and I of this rule to actions for equitable relief; amendment of complaints for equitable relief to request damages permitted. An action for equitable relief brought under sections A and B of this rule may be commenced without compliance with the provisions of section H of this rule. Not less than 30 days after the commencement of an action for equitable relief, and after compliance with the provisions of section H of this rule, the class representative's complaint may be amended without leave of court to include a request for damages. The provisions of section I of this rule shall be applicable if the complaint for injunctive relief is amended to request damages.
 
K Coordination of pending class actions sharing common question of law or fact.
       K(1)(a) When class actions sharing a common question of fact or law are pending in different courts, the presiding judge of any such court, upon motion of any party or on the court's own initiative, may request the Supreme Court to assign a Circuit Court, Court of Appeals, or Supreme Court judge to determine whether coordination of the actions is appropriate, and a judge shall be so assigned to make that determination.
       K(1)(b) Coordination of class actions sharing a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes in a selected site or sites will promote the ends of justice taking into account whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation; the convenience of parties, witnesses, and counsel; the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel; the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and personnel; the calendar of the courts; the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders, or judgments; and the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be denied.
       K(2) If the assigned judge determines that coordination is appropriate, such judge shall order the actions coordinated, report that fact to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the Chief Justice shall assign a judge to hear and determine the actions in the site or sites the Chief Justice deems appropriate.
       K(3) The judge of any court in which there is pending an action sharing a common question of fact or law with coordinated actions, upon motion of any party or on the court's own initiative, may request the judge assigned to hear the coordinated action for an order coordinating such actions. Coordination of the action pending before the judge so requesting shall be determined under the standards specified in subsection (1) of this section.
       K(4) Pending any determination of whether coordination is appropriate, the judge assigned to make the determination may stay any action being considered for, or affecting any action being considered for, coordination.
       K(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Supreme Court shall provide by rule the practice and procedure for coordination of class actions in convenient courts, including provision for giving notice and presenting evidence.
 
L Form of judgment. The judgment in an action ordered maintained as a class action, whether or not favorable to the class, shall specify or describe those found to be members of the class or who, as a condition of exclusion, have agreed to be bound by the judgment. If a judgment that includes a money award is entered in favor of a class, the judgment must, when possible, identify by name each member of the class and the amount to be recovered thereby.
M Attorney fees, costs, disbursements, and litigation expenses.
       M(1)(a) Attorney fees for representing a class are subject to control of the court.
       M(1)(b) If under an applicable provision of law a defendant or defendant class is entitled to attorney fees, costs, or disbursements from a plaintiff class, only representative parties and those members of the class who have appeared individually are liable for those amounts. If a plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees, costs, or disbursements from a defendant class, the court may apportion the fees, costs, or disbursements among the members of the class.
       M(1)(c) If the prevailing class recovers a judgment that can be divided for the purpose, the court may order reasonable attorney fees and litigation expenses of the class to be paid from the recovery.
       M(1)(d) The court may order the adverse party to pay to the prevailing class its reasonable attorney fees and litigation expenses if permitted by law in similar cases not involving a class.
       M(1)(e) In determining the amount of attorney fees for a prevailing class the court shall consider the following factors:
       M(1)(e)(i) The time and effort expended by the attorney in the litigation, including the nature, extent, and quality of the services rendered;
       M(1)(e)(ii) Results achieved and benefits conferred upon the class;
       M(1)(e)(iii) The magnitude, complexity, and uniqueness of the litigation;
       M(1)(e)(iv) The contingent nature of success; and
       M(1)(e)(v) Appropriate criteria in Rule 1.5 of the Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct.
       M(2) Before a hearing under section C of this rule or at any other time the court directs, the representative parties and the attorney for the representative parties shall file with the court, jointly or separately:
       M(2)(a) A statement showing any amount paid or promised them by any person for the services rendered or to be rendered in connection with the action or for the costs and expenses of the litigation and the source of all of the amounts;
       M(2)(b) A copy of any written agreement, or a summary of any oral agreement, between the representative parties and their attorney concerning financial arrangement or fees; and
       M(2)(c) A copy of any written agreement, or a summary of any oral agreement, by the representative parties or the attorney to share these amounts with any person other than a member, regular associate, or an attorney regularly of counsel with the law firm of the representative parties' attorney. This statement shall be supplemented promptly if additional arrangements are made.
 
N Statute of limitations. The statute of limitations is tolled for all class members upon the commencement of an action asserting a class action. The statute of limitations resumes running against a member of a class:
       N(1) Upon filing of an election of exclusion by such class member;
       N(2) Upon entry of an order of certification, or of an amendment thereof, eliminating the class member from the class;
       N(3) Except as to representative parties, upon entry of an order under section C of this rule refusing to certify the class as a class action; and
       N(4) Upon dismissal of the action without an adjudication on the merits.

INTERVENTION
RULE 33
 
A Definition. Intervention takes place when a third person is permitted to become a party to an action between other persons, either by joining the plaintiff in claiming what is sought by the complaint, by uniting with the defendant in resisting the claims of the plaintiff, or by demanding something adversely to both the plaintiff and defendant.
 
B Intervention of right. At any time before trial, any person shall be permitted to intervene in an action when a statute of this state, these rules, or the common law, confers an unconditional right to intervene.
 
C Permissive intervention. At any time before trial, any person who has an interest in the matter in litigation may, by leave of court, intervene. In exercising its discretion, the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.
 
D Procedure. A person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion to intervene upon the parties as provided in Rule 9. The motion shall state the grounds therefor and shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought. If the court allows the intervention, parties shall, within 10 days, file those responsive pleadings which are permitted or required by these rules for such pleading.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; §B amended by 1979 c.284 §21]
 
SUBSTITUTION OF PARTIES
RULE 34
 
A Nonabatement of action by death, disability, or transfer. No action shall abate by the death or disability of a party, or by the transfer of any interest therein, if the claim survives or continues.
 
B Death of a party; continued proceedings. In case of the death of a party, the court shall, on motion, allow the action to be continued:
       B(1) By such party's personal representative or successors in interest at any time within one year after such party's death; or
       B(2) Against such party's personal representative or successors in interest unless the personal representative or successors in interest mail or deliver notice including the information required by ORS 115.003 (3) to the claimant or to the claimant's attorney if the claimant is known to be represented, and the claimant or his attorney fails to move the court to substitute the personal representative or successors in interest within 30 days of mailing or delivery.
 
C Disability of a party; continued proceedings. In case of the disability of a party, the court may, at any time within one year thereafter, on motion, allow the action to be continued by or against the party's guardian or conservator or successors in interest.
 
D Death of a party; surviving parties. In the event of the death of one or more of the plaintiffs or of one or more of the defendants in an action in which the right sought to be enforced survives only to the surviving plaintiffs or only against the surviving defendants, the action does not abate. The death shall be shown upon the record by a written statement of a party signed in conformance with Rule 17 and the action shall proceed in favor of or against the surviving parties.
 
E Transfer of interest. In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.
 
F Public officers; death or separation from office.
       F(1) When a public officer is a party to an action in such officer's official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action does not abate and such officer's successor is automatically substituted as a party. Proceedings following the substitution shall be in the name of the substituted party, but any misnomer not affecting the substantial rights of the parties shall be disregarded. An order of substitution may be entered at any time, but the omission to enter such an order shall not affect the substitution.
       F(2) When a public officer sues or is sued in such officer's official capacity, such officer may be described as a party by official title rather than by name; but the court may require such officer's name to be added.
 
G Procedure. The motion for substitution may be made by any party, or by the successors in interest or representatives of the deceased party or the party with a disability, or the successors in interest of the transferor and shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 9 and upon persons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 7 for the service of a summons.

RULE 35 (Reserved for Expansion)
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISCOVERY
RULE 36
 
A Discovery methods. Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property, for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission.
 
B Scope of discovery. Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:
       B(1) In general. For all forms of discovery, parties may inquire regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things, and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
       B(2) Insurance agreements or policies.
       B(2)(a) A party, upon the request of an adverse party, shall disclose:
       B(2)(a)(i) the existence and contents of any insurance agreement or policy under which a person transacting insurance may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment; and
       B(2)(a)(ii) the existence of any coverage denial or reservation of rights, and identify the provisions in any insurance agreement or policy upon which such coverage denial or reservation of rights is based.
       B(2)(b) The obligation to disclose under this subsection shall be performed as soon as practicable following the filing of the complaint and the request to disclose. The court may supervise the exercise of disclosure to the extent necessary to insure that it proceeds properly and expeditiously. However, the court may limit the extent of disclosure under this subsection as provided in section C of this rule.
       B(2)(c) Information concerning the insurance agreement or policy is not by reason of disclosure admissible in evidence at trial. For purposes of this subsection, an application for insurance shall not be treated as part of an insurance agreement or policy.
       B(2)(d) As used in this subsection, “disclose” means to afford the adverse party an opportunity to inspect or copy the insurance agreement or policy.
       B(3) Trial preparation materials. Subject to the provisions of Rule 44, a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under subsection B(1) of this rule and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative (including an attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of such party's case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.
       A party may obtain, without the required showing, a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party. Upon request, a person who is not a party may obtain, without the required showing, a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that person. If the request is refused, the person or party requesting the statement may move for a court order. The provisions of Rule 46 A(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. For purposes of this subsection, a statement previously made is (a) a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or (b) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.
 
C Court order limiting extent of disclosure. Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, the court in which the action is pending may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following: (1) that the discovery not be had; (2) that the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place; (3) that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery; (4) that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be limited to certain matters; (5) that discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court; (6) that a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of the court; (7) that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; (8) that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court; or (9) that to prevent hardship the party requesting discovery pay to the other party reasonable expenses incurred in attending the deposition or otherwise responding to the request for discovery.
       If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The provisions of Rule 46 A(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.
 
[CCP 12/2/78; §B amended by 1979 c.284 §23; §B(3) amended by CCP 12/13/80; §B amended by CCP 12/11/10]
 
PERPETUATION OF TESTIMONY OR EVIDENCE BEFORE ACTION OR PENDING APPEAL
RULE 37
 
A Before action.
       A(1) Petition. A person who desires to perpetuate testimony or to obtain discovery to perpetuate evidence under Rule 43 or Rule 44 regarding any matter that may be cognizable in any court of this state may file a petition in the circuit court in the county of such person's residence or the residence of any expected adverse party. The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and shall show: (a) that the petitioner, or the petitioner's personal representatives, heirs, beneficiaries, successors, or assigns are likely to be a party to an action cognizable in a court of this state and are presently unable to bring such an action or defend it, or that the petitioner has an interest in real property or some easement or franchise therein, about which a controversy may arise, which would be the subject of such action; (b) the subject matter of the expected action and petitioner's interest therein and a copy, attached to the petition, of any written instrument the validity or construction of which may be called into question or which is connected with the subject matter of the expected action; (c) the facts which petitioner desires to establish by the proposed testimony or other discovery and petitioner's reasons for desiring to perpetuate; (d) the names or a description of the persons petitioner expects will be adverse parties and their addresses so far as one is known; and, (e) the names and addresses of the parties to be examined or from whom discovery is sought and the substance of the testimony or other discovery which petitioner expects to elicit and obtain from each. The petition shall name persons to be examined and ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to take their depositions for the purpose of perpetuating their testimony, or shall name persons in the petition from whom discovery is sought and shall ask for an order allowing discovery under Rule 43 or Rule 44 from such persons for the purpose of preserving evidence.
       A(2) Notice and service. The petitioner shall thereafter serve a notice upon each person named in the petition as an expected adverse party, together with a copy of the petition, stating that the petitioner will apply to the court at a time and place named therein, for the order described in the petition. The notice shall be served either within or without the state in the manner provided for service of summons in Rule 7, but if such service cannot with due diligence be made upon any expected adverse party named in the petition, the court may make such order as is just for service by publication or otherwise, and shall appoint, for persons not served with summons in the manner provided in Rule 7, an attorney who shall represent them and whose services shall be paid for by petitioner in an amount fixed by the court, and, in case they are not otherwise represented, shall cross examine the deponent. Testimony and evidence perpetuated under this rule shall be admissible against expected adverse parties not served with notice only in accordance with the applicable rules of evidence. If any expected adverse party is a minor or incompetent, the provisions of Rule 27 apply.
       A(3) Order and examination. If the court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the testimony or other discovery to perpetuate evidence may prevent a failure or delay of justice, it shall make an order designating or describing the persons whose depositions may be taken and specifying the subject matter of the examination and whether the depositions shall be taken upon oral examination or written questions; or shall make an order designating or describing the persons from whom discovery may be sought under Rule 43 specifying the objects of such discovery; or shall make an order for a physical or mental examination as provided in Rule 44. Discovery may then be had in accordance with these rules. For the purpose of applying these rules to discovery before action, each reference therein to the court in which the action is pending shall be deemed to refer to the court in which the petition for such discovery was filed.
 
B Pending appeal. If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of a court to which these rules apply or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the court in which the judgment was rendered may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony or may allow discovery under Rule 43 or Rule 44 for use in the event of further proceedings in such court. In such case the party who desires to perpetuate the testimony or obtain the discovery may make a motion in the court therefor upon the same notice and service thereof as if the action was pending in the circuit court. The motion shall show: (1) the names and addresses of the persons to be examined or from whom other discovery is sought and the substance of the testimony or other discovery which the party expects to elicit from each; and (2) the reasons for perpetuating their testimony or seeking such other discovery. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony or other discovery is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order as provided in subsection (3) of section A of this rule and thereupon discovery may be had and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in these rules for discovery in actions pending in the circuit court.
 
C Perpetuation by action. This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.
 
D Filing of depositions. Depositions taken under this rule shall be filed with the court in which the petition is filed or the motion is made.
 
[CCP 12/2/78]
 
PERSONS WHO MAY ADMINISTER OATHS FOR DEPOSITIONS; FOREIGN DEPOSITIONS
RULE 38
 
A Within Oregon.
       A(1) Within this state, depositions shall be preceded by an oath or affirmation administered to the deponent by an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of this state or by a person specially appointed by the court in which the action is pending. A person so appointed has the power to administer oaths for the purpose of the deposition.
       A(2) For purposes of this rule, a deposition taken pursuant to Rule 39 C(7) is taken within this state if either the deponent or the person administering the oath is located in this state.
 
B Outside the state. Within another state, or within a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United States, or in a foreign country, depositions may be taken: (1) on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in which the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the United States; (2) before a person appointed or commissioned by the court in which the action is pending, and such a person shall have the power by virtue of such person's appointment or commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony; or (3) pursuant to a letter rogatory. A commission or letter rogatory shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter rogatory that the taking of the deposition in any other manner is impracticable or inconvenient; and both a commission and a letter rogatory may be issued in proper cases. A notice or commission may designate the person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive title. A letter rogatory may be addressed “To the Appropriate Authority in (here name the state, territory, or country).” Evidence obtained in a foreign country in response to a letter rogatory need not be excluded merely for the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that the testimony was not taken under oath or for any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States under these rules.
